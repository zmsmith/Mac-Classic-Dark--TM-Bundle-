mkdir -p ~/Library/Application\ Support/TextMate/Themes
cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/TextMate/Themes
git clone git://github.com/zmsmith/Mac-Classic-Dark--TM-Bundle-.git .

NOTE: This will only work if your ~/Library/Application\ Support/TextMate/Themes directory is empty, but this is the only theme you need anyway
